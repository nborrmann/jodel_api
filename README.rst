Inofficial interface to the private API of the Jodel App. Not affiliated
with *The Jodel Venture GmbH*.

Installation
------------

Using pip:

.. code::

    pip install jodel_api

or using setup.py:

.. code::

    git clone https://github.com/nborrmann/jodel_api.git
    cd jodel_api
    python setup.py install


Usage
-----

Account Creation
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Calling the bare constructor creates a new account:

.. code:: python

    >>> import jodel_api
    >>> lat, lng, city = 48.148434, 11.567867, "Munich"
    >>> j = jodel_api.JodelAccount(lat=lat, lng=lng, city=city)
    Creating new account.

``get_account_data()`` returns all data associated with this account
(censored by me):

.. code:: python

    >>> j.get_account_data()
    {'access_token': 'xxx', 'expiration_date': 1472660000, 'refresh_token': 'xxx', 'distinct_id': 'xxx', 'device_uid': 'xxx'}

Save this data to reuse the account later on, feed it to the
JodelAccount() constructor to reinitiate the account. This constructor
issues one request to update the location of the account.

.. code:: python

    >>> j = jodel_api.JodelAccount(lat=lat, lng=lng, city=city, access_token='xxx', expiration_date='xxx', 
                                   refresh_token='xxx', distinct_id='xxx', device_uid='xxx', is_legacy=True)
    (204, '')

Add ``update_location=False`` to suppress this behaviour. The
constructor will only instantiate an object, without making any remote
calls:

.. code:: python

    >>> j = jodel_api.JodelAccount(lat=lat, lng=lng, city=city, update_location=False, **account_data)

After ``expiration_date`` has passed, call ``refresh_access_tokens()``
to re-authenticate. If ``refresh_access_token`` fails, use
``refresh_all_tokens`` instead (this is akin to creating a new account,
but preserves the account's data (karma, etc)):

.. code:: python

    >>> j.refresh_access_token()
    (200, {'token_type': 'bearer', 'access_token': 'xxx', 'expires_in': 604800, 'expiration_date': xxx})
    >>> j.refresh_all_tokens()
    (200, {'expires_in': 604800, 'access_token': 'xxx', 'token_type': 'bearer', 'returning': True,
           'refresh_token': 'xxx', 'expiration_date': 1472600000, 'distinct_id': 'xxx'})


Account Verification
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

For some functionality like voting and posting (look out for error 478) 
accounts need to be verified. 

With Jodel version ``4.48`` captcha verification has been disabled. 
However old accounts will continue to work with version ``4.47``. But if you
ever use an old, verified account with version ``4.48`` it will become
unverified. To this end, use the flag ``is_legacy=True`` in the 
constructor when you instantiate an old account (on by default). New
accounts must be created with ``is_legacy=False``.

In ``4.48`` accounts can only be verified through Google Cloud Messaging.
The steps are as follows:

1. Create an Android Account: ``a = jodel_api.AndroidAccount()``
2. Request a push token: ``a.get_push_token()``
3. Send push token to Jodel Servers: ``j.send_push_token(token)``
4. Log into GCM and read push messages (``verification_code``) from 
   Jodel: ``verification = a.receive_verification_from_gcm()``
5. Send the verification code to Jodel to verify the account:
   ``a.verify_push(server_time, verification_code)``

In ``jodel_api`` this is implemented as follows:

.. code:: python
   
   a = jodel_api.AndroidAccount()
   j.verify(a)

Tip: If the call is successful, save the account credentials and reuse
them later (if you get ``REGISTRATION_INVALID`` retry with another
account):

.. code:: python
   
   account_id, security_token = a.account_id, a.security_token
   a2 = jodel_api.AndroidAccount(account_id, security_token)


API calls
~~~~~~~~~

All remote API calls return a tuple of HTTP status\_code and the
response (if possible a dict, parsed from the API response), but might
also be a string (error message).

The following API calls are supported (presented without their 
respective responses):


.. code:: python

    # API methods for reading posts:
    >>> j.get_posts_recent(skip=0, limit=60, after=None, mine=False, hashtag=None, channel=None)
    >>> j.get_posts_popular(skip=0, limit=60, after=None, mine=False, hashtag=None, channel=None)
    >>> j.get_posts_discussed(skip=0, limit=60, after=None, mine=False, hashtag=None, channel=None)
    >>> j.get_pictures_recent(skip=0, limit=60, after=None)
    >>> j.get_pictures_popular(skip=0, limit=60, after=None)
    >>> j.get_pictures_discussed(skip=0, limit=60, after=None)
    >>> j.get_my_pinned_posts(skip=0, limit=60, after=None)
    >>> j.get_my_replied_posts(skip=0, limit=60, after=None)
    >>> j.get_my_voted_posts(skip=0, limit=60, after=None)
    >>> j.post_search(message, skip=0, limit=60)    

    # API methods for interacting with single posts:
    >>> j.create_post(message=None, imgpath=None, b64img=None, color=None, ancestor=None, channel="")
    >>> j.get_post_details(post_id)
    >>> # This api endpoint implements paging and returns at most 50 replies,
    >>> # use the skip parameter to page through the thread:
    >>> j.get_post_details_v3(post_id, skip=0) 
    >>> j.upvote(post_id)
    >>> j.downvote(post_id)
    >>> j.give_thanks(post_id)
    >>> j.get_share_url(post_id)
    >>> j.pin(post_id)
    >>> j.unpin(post_id)
    >>> j.enable_notifications(post_id)
    >>> j.disable_notifications(post_id)
    >>> j.delete_post(post_id) # Only works on your own posts ಠ_ಠ

    # API methods for interacting with sticky posts:
    >>> j.upvote_sticky_post(post_id)
    >>> j.downvote_sticky_post(post_id)
    >>> j.dismiss_sticky_post(post_id)

    # API methods for interacting with notifications:
    >>> j.get_notifications()
    >>> j.get_notifications_new()
    >>> j.notification_read(post_id=None, notification_id=None)

    # API methods for interacting with channels:
    >>> j.get_recommended_channels()
    >>> j.get_channel_meta(channel)
    >>> j.follow_channel(channel)
    >>> j.unfollow_channel(channel)

    # API methods for interacting with your user profile:
    >>> j.set_location(lat, lng, city, country=None, name=None) # country and name appear to have no effect
    >>> j.set_user_profile(user_type=None, gender=None, age=None)
    >>> j.get_user_config()
    >>> j.get_karma()
    >>> j.get_captcha()
    >>> j.submit_captcha(key, answer)


The parameters ``skip``,
``limit`` and ``after`` implement paging. While ``skip`` and ``limit``
are integers, ``after`` is a ``post_id`` parameter and will return all
jodels that follow that one. The former two paramters seem to be 
deprecated in favor of the latter, however ``after`` doesn't work
on all ``/mine/`` endpoints (ie. ``mine=True`` or ``get_my_x_posts``).

The arguments ``mine`` (boolean), ``hashtag``, ``channel`` (both strings)
are exclusive. If ``mine`` evaluates to ``true``, the other two arguments
are discarded, if ``hashtag`` evaluates ``true`` , ``channel`` is 
discarded.

``post_search()`` is a new endpoint (as of June 17) that isn't yet
available through the app. It returns all posts from your location
that contain a given string.

You can pass additional arguments (such as proxies and timeouts) to all
API calls through the ``**xargs`` argument that will be passed to the
``requests.request()`` function:

.. code:: python

    >>> j.upvote(post_id, timeout=5, proxies={'https': '127.0.0.1:5000'})
    
For unimplemented endpoints, check `issue #22 
<https://github.com/nborrmann/jodel_api/issues/22/>`_.


Error Codes
~~~~~~~~~~~

-  **401 "Unauthorized"**: Your ``access_token`` is invalid. Either 
   you messed up, or it is outdated. You need to call 
   ``refresh_access_token()`` or ``refresh_all_token()`` (check the 
   above section on account creation).
-  **401 "Action not allowed"**: You are using a ``4.48`` account 
   with ``is_legacy=True``, but ``4.48`` accounts are not allowed
   to downgrade.
-  **403 "Access Denied"**: Your IP is banned accross endpoints,
   just read-only endpoints still work. Effective for 24 hours.
-  **429 "Too Many Requests"**: Your IP is rate-limited. Applies only
   to one specific endpoint.
-  **477 "Signed Request Expected"**: This library should handle request
   signing. Make sure to upgrade to the latest version of ``jodel_api``,
   as the signing key changes every few weeks.
-  **478 "Account not verified"**: Verify the account through GCM.
-  **502 "Bad Gateway"**: Something went wrong server-side. This happens
   pretty randomly. ``jodel_api`` automatically retries two times when
   it sees this error. If you encounter this status, the jodel servers
   are probably having issues. Try again later.

Rate-Limits
~~~~~~~~~~~

The Jodel API appears to have the following (IP-based) rate-limits

-  max of 200 new account registrations from one IP per half hour
-  max of 200 votes per minute
-  max of 100 captcha requests per minute

They also hand out 403 bans if you overdo it.

Tests
-----

Nearly all tests in ``jodel_api_test.py`` are integration tests, which
actually hit the Jodel servers. These can fail for any number of reasons
(eg. connectivity issues), which does not necessarily imply there is
something wrong with this library. As this library tries to make few
assumptions about the content of the json responses they test mostly for
status codes, not the contents of the responses (ie. they test whether
the API endpoints are still valid).

-  For the tests in ``class TestUnverifiedAccount`` a new account is
   created on every run and they test GCM verification, posting and
   read-only functions   
-  Tests in ``class TestLegacyVerifiedAccount`` need an already verified
   legacy account and test if it still works.
   To run these tests you need to verify an account by
   solving the captcha and save its ``device_uid`` in the
   environment variable ``JODEL_ACCOUNT_LEGACY``. Run
   ``j.get_account_data()['device_uid']`` to get the value.

   Linux:

   ::

       export JODEL_ACCOUNT_LEGACY=a8aa02[...]dba

   Windows (you need to restart the cmd/shell for this to take effect,
   or set it through gui):

   ::

       setx JODEL_ACCOUNT_LEGACY a8aa02[...]dba

   If this variable is not present, these tests will be skipped.

Clone the directory, install the library and run the tests with

.. code:: python

    python setup.py test
